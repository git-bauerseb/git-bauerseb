### Welcome!

I like creating things with my computer and I'm also a hobby magician. Don't believe me? Then let's try this mind (blowing) experiment:

  1) Think of any positive number
  2) Now square this number and add it to your initial number
  3) Divide the result from 2. by your initial number
  4) In the next step, subtract your initial number from the number you got in step 3
  5) Because of my magic abilities, if you now add `17` to the number you got in step 4 and divide by 6 you'll get a final result... Let me think about it.... *Abracadabra* it should be **3**
